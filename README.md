# Obstacle-detection-Robot-using-Ultrasonic-Sensor-and-Arduino-UNO

You can check it's video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nr7D39Pj4g4 and you can contact us at info [@] deligence.com in case you have any query. You can also contact us at sales [@] deligence.com in case of any Development requirement.

Here we have implemented a bot which is going to detect obstacle and according to that, it going to change its direction.

For this we require 
•    Arduino UNO
•    Ultrasonic Sensor
•    L298d
•    Dc gear Motor

Now first we are going to connect all ultrasonic sensor with our Arduino board. Then according to program our all ultrasonic sensor going generate a trigger signal which is going to receive by our echo pin of Ultrasonic Sensor.
Then we are going to run an algorithm according which we are going to manipulate our desire distance for obstacle detection then we are going to control our motor rotation direction for movement of our bot.
